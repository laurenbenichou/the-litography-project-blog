<p>Nowadays, most books are quickly put together, or bound, in
large factories. Reams of paper whir through mechanized assembly
lines, and huge blades slice thick piles of pages, shooting out
best-sellers in minutes. </p>

<p>But there are still a few bookbinders who do it the old-fashioned
way. They use tools with names like bone folders, job
backers, and guillotines - along with sewing machines, glue and
paper - to make new books.And to restore old ones. San
Francisco used to be a hub for the craft. Before
the 1906 earthquake, there were over  30 traditional book
binderies in the Bay Area. Today, only a few
remain.</p>

<p>Litography's Angela Johnston takes us to a workshop in the Mission
where a bookbinder is keeping a centuries-old tradition alive.</p>
