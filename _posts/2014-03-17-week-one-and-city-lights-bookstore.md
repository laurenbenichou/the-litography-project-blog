<p>We're one week in to our Kickstarter campaign, and we just passed the halfway mark toward our goal! We have been feeling so much love this week from friends, family, favorite radio producers of ours, and lovely people we have yet to meet. It's great to see the excitment build. We're off to a great start, thanks to every one of you! </p>
 
<p>This week we've also been doing what we set out to do: producing fascinating audio stories about literature in the Bay Area. One in the works is a love letter to City Lights Bookstore, a literary monument and a steadfast space in a sea of change. City lights is not only a store; it represents a movement, a mindset, and dedication to a vision. We spoke to people who spend their days there, whether working by the door or browsing the three floors of books, about what City Lights means to them. </p>
 
<p>A special thanks to Paul Yamazaki, the incredibly knowledgeable City Lights book buyer, for sitting down with us in the bookworm's heaven that he calls an office.</p>

<p>We hope you'll all get a chance to listen to this and more stories coming soon. In the meantime, lets keep the momentum going</p>
